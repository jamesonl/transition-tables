The purpose of this repository is to implement a function that produces [markov chains](https://brilliant.org/wiki/markov-chains/) for any given text.

Markov dictionaries (and their corresponding probabilities) are useful when trying to determine the next word in a sequence. These are regularly used in chat bot applications, as well as search.

## History of the Project

This was back from the days when the majority of my analytics focused on breaking down text comments. While the sample data is pulled from twitter, the applications extend far beyond simply chaining words together. This provides a strong indication of the traditional kinds of statements that can be made, and how this bag of words can be organized in order to prioritize the kinds of problems that a company can collect through text.
